#### Why change to SweetProcess?

We found that ProcedureUs was a difficult to pronounce word, and there were plenty of spelling mistakes when typing it out. The last thing we wanted was to confuse people. We needed a new name, which still captured the purpose: Standard Operating Procedures for rapid business growth. 

SweetProcess is short and memorable - and the domain name was available. We've got big plans for SweetProcess. We want to be the reason behind thousands of businesses learning to scale and systemize.

#### What should I look for in a business name?
If you are looking to rename, or start a new business - picking a name is difficult. Doubly so if it is your first time because you don't know where to begin.

Paul Graham talks about the [importance of a business name](http://aux.messymatters.com/pgnames.html). He says that:

> One of the hardest problems new startups face is choosing a name. All the good domain names seem to be taken — and not by other companies, but by domain squatters.

There is good news though:

> The good news is, the feeling that all the good names are taken is an illusion. It must be, because I felt it in 1995. Squatters have registered huge numbers of names, certainly, but they can’t register names as fast as 26 to the power of n grows.

Paul is saying that there are just **so many different combinations of names**, that while you may not be able to register `cool.com`, it doesn't matter because there are plenty of other names out there that actually represent what you do.

The secret he says is that the best names:

> are both cool words and refer to what the company does

like `writely` (which was bought by Google and became Google Docs). But if you can't get something that is cool **and** refers to what you do, at least ensure you pick a word that sounds cool (perhaps easy to pronounce fits here) or isn't actively repulsive. 

#### Keeping your name

Changing your company name isn't easy. There are so many places that need to be updated (new twitter account names, email addresses, letterheads and business cards). And while you are growing the company, it can be a major distraction. 

So pick a pronounceable name, test it on a few customers (or friends and family members if you don't have customers) and without prompting see if they can say it correctly. And then get on with building up your business.
