My quarterly mail from the tax man puts me in a bad mood. Not because it means that the bank balance will soon be reduced. Tax mail means more paper work.

Today I will talk about how our quarterly "Business Activity Statement" cost two hours of work and seeded a dream that one day we could do better.

####A simple tax form
Every quarter the Australian Tax Office mails through a Business Activity Statement (BAS) for us to fill out (like a form 1120 in the United States). Our online accounting package can generate a pre-filled report identical in format to the BAS. Now filling out the BAS should be straight-forward right?

####That wasted two hours
Well, except every quarter I forget that one section of the report isn't pre-filled and I need to enter those numbers manually. What ensues is probably a familiar story for you - it takes me a 2 hour journey to discover:

1. A section of the form hasn't been pre-filled.
*I'm staring at this report thinking - that entire section is filled with zeros, that can't be right!*
2. There isn't a setting to get those numbers to be automatically pre-filled
*I use the accounting help system, which is very good and explains that I will need to enter those numbers myself.*
3. There is another report I can run to get the numbers I need
*I find the report that I need and double check its numbers.*
4. I did this same dance last quarter
*Task finished and feeling frustrated I have this strange sensation they call deja vu. I realise that this same thing happened last quarter. *

####Why can't I document my steps?
Why don't we all write down in a blog or Word document somewhere the problems we have and how they were resolved. Call it a lessons learned log - but I am sure 200 other business owners waste time on the exact same problems.

####Why can't everyone else follow those steps too?
Let's build a place where business owners can learn from the steps written by other business owners. A place to search and find complete steps for any administrative task.
