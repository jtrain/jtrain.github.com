You are desiging a landing page for your new product. The layout is taken care of - you've purchased a template on [themeforest](http://themeforest.net/). You're copy is looking really sharp because of the advice you read on [copyhackers](http://copyhackers.com/). Now all you need to do is fill in that blank space on the right. 

Should you have a product screenshot, some stock photography or a video? According to some [studies](http://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/the-benefits-of-using-video-on-landing-pages/) a video on your landing page can increase conversions up to 80%. And yet - **I've been reluctant to create videos** in the past. Here are some of my reasons:

 - *I didn't know where to start*. I don't own any expensive recording equipment
 - This landing page was for a product I haven't built yet! *I can't afford to hire a professional* to produce it for me
 - *I hate the sound of my voice*. I might scare overseas visitors away with my Australian accent.
 
#### Create your own landing page video, without the expensive equipment

#### What is in this post?
To make your own video, you'll need to follow these steps:

 - Writing a script
 - Animation
 - Voice Over
 - Editing

I'll cover my method for animation in depth in this article. And provide brief explanations for the other topics. 
 
#### First create the script

[Miguel Hernandez](http://grumomedia.com/how-to-create-videos-that-get-you-customers-mixergy-interview-with-miguel-hernandez-of-grumo-media/):

> by the way the most important thing is the script part

Without a script, you'll be flying in the dark. Before recording this video, I had no idea about how to write a script. I mostly write Python code all day and my script writing skills are very rusty. So if I managed to write a script, I'm sure that you could pull it off.

I listened to [Miguel Hernandez' interview with Andrew Warner](http://mixergy.com/persuasive-product-videos/) to get some tips about how he approaches script writing:

 - Tell a personal story first - don't talk about 'most people' talk about a specific story that someone can relate to
 - Keep it short - about 60 seconds should be your target
 - Keep it simple - Don't overwhelm the audience with a list of features
