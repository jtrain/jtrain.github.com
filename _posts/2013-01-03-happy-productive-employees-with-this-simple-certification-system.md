#### The secret behind Nick's success
Nick Sarillo is a restauranteur from Chicago. He runs a successful chain of pizza restaurants called "Nicks Pizza and Pub". Part of the secret behind his success his workforce of nearly 200 staff. Nick has systemized their training, so that a new employee that joins the company can see very clearly the areas that they can learn and what skillset they need to demonstrate before they can get their next raise. 

Nick training "university" is a system made of small courses and milestones that employees can take and accomplish in order to be certified for a task.

> I would actually have someone certified in answering phones, and how to answer phones. So through that process, I started –even rolling the dough. You know, most restaurants don’t certify someone just for rolling dough, but I broke it down. I said, “I want you to get certified in this piece first, then get certified in making pizzas; have 40 consecutive hours without a mistake; and you’re certified and things like that. That’s what I did.

#### How to develop your own version of Nicks certification system
Let's break this certification system down, and understand how we can apply it to our own businesses.

#### The keys to a certification system

Nick identified **4 key aspects** that drive the success of his certification system. Together they are what make the whole system work. 

1. Documentation
2. Clear Direction
3. Social Proof
4. Reward

##### Documentation

This is the meat of the training system. You **must** write down how things should be done. What happens if you don't document your training? Well you training becomes an oral tradition that is passed down from person to person. The training will vary greatly depending on who delivers it, *and what they remember to say*. You'll find that your training process will have a larger variance of outcomes. Some very successful and some spectactular failures.

Written documentation doesn't need to be boring, or long. It could be a series of videos, a bound instruction manual, some illustrated step - by - step guides or even a series of posters that you have hanging up in the training room.

##### Clear Direction

Without knowing where we are headed, we can quickly become frustrated. Boost your employee's engagement by showing them exactly the path they are on, and where it leads to.

Nick uses a publicly mounted display board that shows:

1. All of the certifications that are available; and
2. Which certifications have been completed by **each** employee 

Certifications have different levels of mastery. You can be a 101 level in bread making and then complete additional training to be certified at 202 level and so on.
Nick's public certification board serves as the roadmap for new employees so they know where they stand today, and where they can grow in the future.

##### Social Proof

Nick says that you can not only monitor your team's progress but most importantly your own against the team. Making the certification board public was an essential step in building the team moral. Team members encourage each other as they complete new certifications. What develops is a culture that prizes continued development. 

##### Reward

Finally a certification system in itself could seem less sweet if there were no reward for completing certificates. Nick uses reward as the icing on the cake to further inspire employees to continue their development. And as they do, they become more valuable to the company.

Nick has written the pay levels next to each certification on the board for everyone to see. Now employees can see how to get raises. It adds one more motivation to continue completing the certification.

#### Automate your training

Nick used a certification system to inspire and challenge his workforce. As a result, he reports that the employees are more valuable to the company and are a driver behind his success in business. 

How can you use the key steps:

1. Documentation
2. Clear Direction
3. Social Proof; and
4. Reward
