#### The secret behind Nick's success
Nick Sarillo is a restauranteur from Chicago. He runs a successful chain of pizza restaurants called "Nicks Pizza and Pub". Part of the secret behind his success his workforce of nearly 200 staff. Nick has systemized their training, so that a new employee that joins the company can see very clearly the areas that they can learn and what skillset they need to demonstrate before they can get their next raise. 

Nick training "university" is a system made of small courses and milestones that employees can take and accomplish in order to be certified for a task.

> I would actually have someone certified in answering phones, and how to answer phones. So through that process, I started –even rolling the dough. You know, most restaurants don’t certify someone just for rolling dough, but I broke it down. I said, “I want you to get certified in this piece first, then get certified in making pizzas; have 40 consecutive hours without a mistake; and you’re certified and things like that. That’s what I did.

#### How to develop your own version of Nicks certification system
Let's break this certification system down, and understand how we can apply it to our own businesses. We'll use the example of a local retail supermarket.

#### The keys to a certification system

Nick identified **4 key aspects** that drive the success of his certification system. Together they are what make the whole system work. 

1. Documentation
2. Clear Direction
3. Social Proof
4. Reward

##### Documentation

This is the meat of the training system. You **must** write down how things should be done. What happens if you don't document your training? Well you training becomes an oral tradition that is passed down from person to person. The training will vary greatly depending on who delivers it, *and what they remember to say*. You'll find that your training process will have a larger variance of outcomes. Some very successful and some spectactular failures.

Written documentation doesn't need to be boring, or long. It could be a series of videos, a bound instruction manual, some illustrated step - by - step guides or even a series of posters that you have hanging up in the training room.
