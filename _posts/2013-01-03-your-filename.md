How to do you manage your LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook pages? Posting things to each individually is taking up your deal-making and client work time. And logging into each to monitor what people are saying is also a waste. Why not use all three at once? Write once, post everywhere.

#### Introducing Hootsuite

We use [Hootsuite (a free social media tool)](https://hootsuite.com) to combine our LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook pages. It is a case of post once, and Hootsuite delivers the message to all three social sites. And we use Hootsuite to automatically schedule our posts. So we can post whenever we feel like, but our followers don't get them all at once, instead they are gradually delivered throughout the day.

Here's our 6 step illustrated guide to using Hootsuite to [post to Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter](https://www.procedureus.com/procedures/78/post-from-twitter-facebook-and-linkedin-from-hootsuite/) at the same time. 

Another option is Twitter's [TweetDeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/) which despite the name also supports one Facebook account.
