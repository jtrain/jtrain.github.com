Use the tools that the pros use to post to LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter all at the same time. Posting things to each individually takes up **your** client work time. Stop wasting time logging into Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. Why not use all three at once? Write once, post everywhere.

#### Introducing Hootsuite

We use [Hootsuite (a free social media tool)](https://hootsuite.com) to combine our LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook pages. It is a case of post once, and Hootsuite delivers the message to all three social sites. And we use Hootsuite to automatically schedule our posts. So we can post whenever we feel like, but our followers don't get them all at once, instead they are gradually delivered throughout the day.

Here's our 6 step illustrated guide to using Hootsuite to [post to Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter](https://www.procedureus.com/procedures/78/post-from-twitter-facebook-and-linkedin-from-hootsuite/) at the same time. 

Another option is Twitter's [TweetDeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/) which despite the name also supports one Facebook account.
