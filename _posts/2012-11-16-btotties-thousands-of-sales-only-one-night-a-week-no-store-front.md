Lucy Simms and Amanda Cordner are co-founders of B’totties, selling shorts that encapsulate the summer spirit of fun and frivolity all year round. I met with them both in a quiet-ish corner of a bar on Southbank, Melbourne to learn about how they quickly grew their company to reach thousands of sales.

Here we discuss the secrets behind the B'totties success. If you are in the mood to read an edited transcription of the interview you can find that here.

####Picking the right co-founder
Amanda and Lucy had just finished uni and were living together. Despite graduating and working in different fields, they would talk about how they would love to one day run their own business. What was idle talk began to take form during a beach holiday when Lucy, wearing a pair of colourful shorts her mother made, received a series of compliments about her unique shorts. That was all they needed to decide, then and there, to chase this idea down.

####Your business plan doesn’t have to be so fancy
The planning and research consisted of a spreadsheet, detailing only the essentials of profit and loss. They estimated how much the shorts would cost to manufacture and how much they could sell them for before concluding the business could turn a profit. By focusing on the essentials of the business, the pair were able to avoid the common pitfall of analysis paralysis and move on to the implementation of the plan.

####But you still need a goal
Early on, they decided that they would take out a business loan to cover part of the capital costs. Fortunately, the entrepreneurial cousins managed to divert what is usually seen as a burden, into a positive driving force. "Taking out a loan adds a bit of pressure, it adds some drive to get it done," concluded the pair.

####You don’t need to be an expert in your field
Neither founder had made clothes before or worked in the fashion industry. One of the first things they learned is that they needed a pattern for a manufacturer to make shorts. Even without experience the two knew that the most important thing was a good looking and comfortable pair of shorts. Thirty of their extended family and friends were enlisted to test the first sample batch of shorts. During this phase, their friends and family were often met with the unconventional greeting, "drop your dacks, put these on, and give us your comments." The detailed notes Lucy and Amanda garnered from this research led to a perfected second sample batch and progress onto the market.

####Your friends and family are happy to support you
It took nine months from first idea to flicking the switch on the website to begin selling. The sales for that first week were huge. They spread word about the store via their family, work mates and uni friends on Facebook, on the phone and in emails.

####To continue the sales you need to find your niche
Selling to friends and family is a great start, but further sales are dependent on identifying who your customer is. Who are the people that will do anything to get their hands on your product and are willing to pay? Amanda and Lucy tried selling at schools, markets and other places before discovering they belonged on the beach. Their beach going customers now represent the core of their repeat business and provide a base for them to expand into other areas like a range for kids.
 
####Getting it wrong sometimes is alright
Not everything needs to work out according to plan for you to succeed. The pair have tried sponsoring some Melbourne swim meets and not sold any shorts. Some of their media releases aren’t picked up by newspapers or online. The important thing is to learn from your mistakes, why didn’t the sponsorship work? Why didn’t the newspapers pick up that story? Look carefully at these failures and make adjustments for next time.

Thanks to Lucy and Amanda for telling your story. If you would love a fun pair of shorts for the beach, your next big swim or a gift check out [www.btotties.com.au](http://www.btotties.com.au).
