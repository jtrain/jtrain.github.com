Lucy Simms and Amanda Cordner are co-founders of B’totties, selling shorts that encapsulate the summer spirit of fun and frivolity all year round. I met with them both in a quiet-ish corner of a bar on Southbank, Melbourne to learn about how they quickly grew their company to reach thousands of sales.

This is an edited transcription of their interview. We have also published a [shorter version](/blog/btotties-thousands-of-sales-only-one-night-a-week-no-store-front/) where we discuss the secrets behind the B'totties success.

####Before B’totties
We were living together at the time. So that always makes it easier. We had very different careers but very similar business minds. We figured that out living with each other. 

We used to talk about our new jobs having just finished uni. These companies \[our employers\] are making a fortune out of us, and paying us nothing. Wouldn’t it be great to have something of our own? 

We were both definitely entrepreneurial before starting B’totties. It was going to be a different challenge for us. We knew it would be unlike any other job, and it never has been like a "job"; if it was \[like any other job\], it would have dissolved by now. 

####An idea born on a beach holiday
We were on a holiday one year, and I \[Lucy\] had shorts that were very similar to the ones that we sell now. My Mum had made them for me. And I always used to get comments about these shorts, and I loved them. We were on holiday and someone made a comment once and I think we just said lets do it. From that day we put plans together and started going for it. 

####Our first step
We put together a business plan, but had zero idea where to even start, didn’t have a clue. We had some conversations about where is the gap in the market. How did Peter Alexander come in and do a backyard job in the garage and now he’s selling his company for $40 million bucks, and we thought we could do that.

So it started kind of as Pyjamas, but as the business grew it kind of moved more towards the beach. Some people still wear them as Pyjamas but each to their own. 

We probably sat down and didn’t think long term about where we were going to sell it or how we would sell it. We thought about how we are going to make them - how much money do we need to make them - what could we sell it for. We put those in a very basic spreadsheet to calculate profit and costs and that was it. 

We both put in how much we thought we could afford at the time, and what we thought we should be putting in. We took out a loan to cover the remainder of the cost. Taking out a loan adds a bit of pressure, it adds some drive to get it done. We had a plan for how long it would take us to pay back the loan and a few goals in place to get that done. We were paying rent, Amanda was saving to buy a place, its not like we had cash that we could throw around. We thought we could do it and pay off the loan in a couple of years. We think what might deter a lot of people from starting a business is that you need the capital. Taking out a loan isn’t something people like doing. But we had the confidence in our product and the idea, so we had the mindset that we could pull it off. We thought our plan was pretty realistic.

####Iterate the design
We had to work out A) where to buy the fabric from and B) we didn’t have a pattern (we didn't even know you needed a pattern) to make shorts. We thought, “oh what’s a pattern - we need to find a pattern maker”. We went to Spotlight and bought 10 m of spotty fabric. Then we searched out and contacted three manufacturers through referrals from family and friends.

We went to meet the manufacturers with the original shorts and asked how much it would cost to make. We never considered making these ourselves because we didn’t have the time. Although every second person asks whether or not we had sewn them ourselves. All manufacturers were based in Melbourne so we could get out and meet them. We narrowed them down to two and we asked if they could give a pattern. One offered to give patterns in a couple of sizes.

The first sample batch was made and we had 20-30 people try them on. We looked for all sorts of problems, a bit tight around the bum, things that looked a bit funny and not right. Anyone that walked through our door we were like, “drop your dacks, put these on, and give us your comments”. We got them to write out notes about how they felt.

We went back to the manufacturer and got them adjusted and were happy with the next round of samples which is quite good, we were lucky. One of the manufacturers was this one girl and she was going to do it on her own. The other was a guy with about 30 girls who made for Kookai and other well known labels. He was a bit more expensive, but he was very fussy. We were happy to pay a bit more to get a good quality product because we felt the first shorts needed to be perfect. 

Then we tried to contact Spotlight to find their supplier, which of course they didn’t like but eventually we got through to someone and found out who their wholesaler was and we were able to get the wholesale prices. We didn’t have to get any minimum order because we had an ABN. 


####The first sale
It took about nine months from the idea to the product, we decided to start the business early April 2009 and we had a deadline to get them ready on the 1st of December, that ended up being the day when we picked up the shorts and flicked on the website. 

Of course when we went live my sister had to be the first one to online and buy the shorts. She started going through the site and after five seconds of going 'live' we get this, “ring ring - your websites not working I can’t buy them,” so we spent the whole day on the phone trying to fix this while we were both at work. Amanda was in and out of the quiet room abusing the hosting provider on the phone saying, “get this to work!”

####Reaching out to new customers
We sold quite a few during that week, I think it spread. Word spread between all of us and our family who were saying, “our girls made this”. We used Facebook, sent it out to everyone that we knew. People who were close to us were really helpful and sent it on. Our Uncle is a sales director at a company and he sent it to the whole building. AU-Sales, bang the whole building just got the email so it spread like wildfire really.

So that month we were spending every night packing to meet all of these orders. Our back room was getting full. We needed a lot of room to store the fabric and elastic, store the shorts and store all of their files. A fair chunk of those early orders was through word of mouth only. Word of mouth was a key thing for that \[2009\] year. 

Then we needed to extend our reach. Because we were from the surf coast we decided to get in touch with the surf clubs and said, “we are beachy and from that kind of area”. We put calls out to everyone, to schools, but the surf clubs were really the ones that responded. 

We knew the surf club at Point Lonsdale, \[and at\] the other clubs, we knew who to call and they would get our details and put in a word for us. We’d call them and say we’re so and so’s mate we’ve been Point Lonsdale girls forever. The Point Lonsdale connection helped us, and from it we sponsored their Swim Classic Event. It went so well, we could then use it as a sell story to other clubs. We put together little fliers, saying this is what we did, how the swimmers loved it,  putting their B’totties over their bathers after the swim. 

Thats how we got our loyal base. People come to swim there every year and they see us there and they love our shorts. Every year 50% of the people that buy, come because they have worn their last ones the entire year. 

The personality of B’totties was bright, fun and summer and that fit in really well with the beach. On holidays I always wore mine over my bathers. We tried to sell in all sorts of locations, we tried markets and that didn’t really work and we got no where. 

No one else was selling anything like us at the beach, just wetsuits and boardshorts; nothing else. Holiday makers are there to spend money and the shop that stocks us keep calling to ask for more because they had sold out. These holidaymakers are paying retail prices but they don’t care because they just love the shorts. The shops are ideal for us; we give them stock when they need it, and in turn get a cheque at the end of the month.

####Here is how to get featured in the media
We proactively staged media attention. We do little PR releases, get photos, do a little spiel, make it look pretty and just email it. \[We have emailed it\] to The Age, the Herald Sun, the Geelong Advertiser all the local newsletters. If we get a bite and the story is published then we get free advertising. 

I don’t know if that gets us any real sales. 

####A typical day at a Swim Event
We only sponsor the open water swim events a few weekends in the year, four or five of them. Early in the morning we load up the car, tables, shorts, deck chairs, suncream and food. This year we have the B’totties flag which has been a real winner - a massive winner. Then we drive.

If there is an MC we go and give him a pair, make friends with him, and then give him a script about B’totties. \[We\] then try to 'get in' with as many people as we can. As soon as \[the MC\] mentions us or reads our script we start going crazy so people know that he is talking about us. There is a cafe on the street which is where all of the people go and is very well known in Point Lonsdale. All day it is chockers, even more-so when the swim event is on. This year we went in and got the waitresses, all the girls, to wear B’totties all day. That is the key. For people to be seen in them.

And when people buy them we encourage them to put them on right then. Because as soon as people see other people wearing them, they look around to find where they can get some. It just spreads like wildfire. So we put out the call before hand to everyone that has a pair to come down and wear their B’totties, that is the key to a successful day on the beach. 

The kids range is new last summer, that one has gone really, really well. My mum sent through a message saying she saw a mum and dad and two little kids wearing matching B’totties. 

####What didn’t work out so well
We wear them whenever possible. We did this massive B’totties amazing race at fed square. Everyone had to wear B’totties and a white top . They were given clues and had to run around the whole city. We lined up 30 people all in B’totties. Our parents even formed a team of four but the younger ones won the race. I got a text saying, “I just saw 30 people running past all wearing B'totties in the middle of the city,” from a colleague.

Then we got a photo with everyone all lined up with their bums to the camera and their hands in the air. We tried to send that story around but it didn’t pick up, we thought MX might but it didn’t really take.

Some swim events don’t work, like the Melbourne swim didn’t work. We have tried putting in a lot of money to be a sponsor for some swim events and not sold a single pair of shorts. 

####If you are starting out
You need to have confidence in your product and yourself. Be willing to make calculated risk and willing to lose. If things go belly up just take the hit. But don’t make the same mistake again.

We are perfectly fine calling and talking to people that are in our contacts, family, uni or work. We use that and it works. 

Facebook hasn’t really worked at all for sales, but it is helpful to get the word out. It gives you someone to talk to and tell about events.

When we have specials at Christmas time or free postage we sent out an email and we do get an increase in sales. Facebook hasn’t equated to sales but it does keep it top of mind for people.
